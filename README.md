## 📘 Project Description

Fire Thermomist is an IoT-based safety and environment monitoring system designed to detect fire, monitor humidity and temperature in real-time, and display dynamic animations on an OLED screen. It is ideal for deployment in environments like server rooms where overheating or fire can cause critical damage.

The project uses:

* A DHT22 sensor for temperature & humidity
* A flame sensor for fire detection
* An OLED display for real-time visualization & animated UI
* A buzzer for alarm when fire is detected

Boot time and idle animations provide an enhanced interactive experience. When fire is detected, the system alerts via buzzer and a flame animation on OLED.

* Weather animation (sunrise → rain → sunset)
* Real-time temp & humidity monitoring via DHT22
* Fire detection via IR flame sensor
* Frame-based OLED animation logic
* Buzzer alert system on fire detection

2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search for **PlatformIO IDE**
4. Click **Install**

### 🚀 How to Create a Project in PlatformIO:

1. Open PlatformIO home (alien icon in VS Code sidebar)
2. Click **New Project**
3. Enter name: `FireThermomist`
4. Board: **Espressif ESP32 Dev Module**
5. Framework: **Arduino**
6. Click **Finish** and wait for project to initialize
